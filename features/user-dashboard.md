# User Dashboard Feature

## Overview
Create a comprehensive user dashboard that displays user statistics, recent activity, and account management features. This feature will serve as a test case for the Claude Worktree Agent.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **User Statistics Display**
   - Show total projects created
   - Display recent login activity
   - Show account creation date
   - Display storage usage metrics

2. **Recent Activity Feed**
   - List last 10 user actions with timestamps
   - Filter by action type (create, update, delete)
   - Show activity for last 30 days
   - Include pagination for older activities

3. **Account Management**
   - Edit profile information (name, email, bio)
   - Change password functionality
   - Upload/update profile picture
   - Account deletion option (with confirmation)

### Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Include error handling and user feedback
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Add unit tests for all components
- Implement proper accessibility features

### API Integration
- Connect to `/api/user/stats` endpoint
- Use `/api/user/activity` for activity feed
- Profile updates via `/api/user/profile`
- Image upload to `/api/user/avatar`

### UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, modern interface
- Consistent with existing design system
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Keyboard navigation support

- [ ] Filter functionality works correctly
- [ ] Empty state when no activities exist

### Profile Management
- [ ] Form validation for all fields

- [ ] Image upload with preview
- [ ] Password change with confirmation

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Works on mobile devices (320px+)
- [ ] Tablet layout optimization
- [ ] Desktop layout with sidebar navigation
- [ ] Touch-friendly interface elements

### Accessibility

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for API interactions  
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load activity feed data
- Optimize images (WebP format)
- Cache user statistics
- Debounce search/filter inputs

## Dependencies
- React Query for API state management
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Hot Toast for notifications
- Framer Motion for smooth animations

## Future Enhancements
- Dark mode support
- Export user data functionality
- Two-factor authentication setup
- Advanced analytics charts
- Social features integration
